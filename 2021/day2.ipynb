    "Now, you need to figure out how to <span title=\"Tank, I need a pilot program for a B212 helicopter.\">pilot this thing</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like the submarine can take a series of commands like `forward 1`, `down 2`, or `up 3`:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `forward X` increases the horizontal position by `X` units.\n",
    "*   `down X` _increases_ the depth by `X` units.\n",
    "*   `up X` _decreases_ the depth by `X` units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since you're on a submarine, `down` and `up` affect your _depth_, and so they have the opposite result of what you might expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submarine seems to already have a planned course (your puzzle input). You should probably figure out where it's going. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    forward 5\n",
    "    down 5\n",
    "    forward 8\n",
    "    up 3\n",
    "    down 8\n",
    "    forward 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Your horizontal position and depth both start at `0`. The steps above would then modify them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `forward 5` adds `5` to your horizontal position, a total of `5`.\n",
    "*   `down 5` adds `5` to your depth, resulting in a value of `5`.\n",
    "*   `forward 8` adds `8` to your horizontal position, a total of `13`.\n",
    "*   `up 3` decreases your depth by `3`, resulting in a value of `2`.\n",
    "*   `down 8` adds `8` to your depth, resulting in a value of `10`.\n",
    "*   `forward 2` adds `2` to your horizontal position, a total of `15`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After following these instructions, you would have a horizontal position of `15` and a depth of `10`. (Multiplying these together produces _`150`_.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. _What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?_"

    "\n",
    "*   `forward 5` adds `5` to your horizontal position, a total of `5`. Because your aim is `0`, your depth does not change.\n",
    "*   `down 5` adds `5` to your aim, resulting in a value of `5`.\n",
    "*   `forward 8` adds `8` to your horizontal position, a total of `13`. Because your aim is `5`, your depth increases by `8*5=40`.\n",
    "*   `up 3` decreases your aim by `3`, resulting in a value of `2`.\n",
    "*   `down 8` adds `8` to your aim, resulting in a value of `10`.\n",
    "*   `forward 2` adds `2` to your horizontal position, a total of `15`. Because your aim is `10`, your depth increases by `2*10=20` to a total of `60`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After following these new instructions, you would have a horizontal position of `15` and a depth of `60`. (Multiplying these produces _`900`_.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this new interpretation of the commands, calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. _What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?_\n"
